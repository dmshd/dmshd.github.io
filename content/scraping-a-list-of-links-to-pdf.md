# Scraping a list of links to PDF documents on a website

## Introduction

This is a simple Python script to scrape a list of links to PDF documents on a website. I have used this script to scrape a list of links to PDF documents on a website that I was interested in. The website had a list of links to PDF documents, but the links were not in a format that I could easily copy and paste into a spreadsheet. I wanted to be able to copy and paste the links into a spreadsheet, so that I could easily download the PDF documents.
