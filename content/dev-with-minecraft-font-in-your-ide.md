## Minecraft font in your IDE

I just found out that you can use the Minecraft font in your IDE, it's pretty cool.

## Where to find the Minecraft font

You can find the Minecraft font on [this website](https://www.dafont.com/minecraft.font).
```
daniel@debian:~/.local/share$ mkdir fonts
daniel@debian:~/.local/share$ cd -
/home/daniel/Téléchargements
daniel@debian:~/Téléchargements$ mv Monocraft.otf ~/.local/share/fonts
```
## Conclusionabout the Monocraft font in VSCode
 
It is fun but it is not very useful in my opinion since it is barely readable.
