A Tune a Day clarinet book by C. Paul Herfurth
----------------------------------------------

This book was recommended to me by my colleague who got a master degree in Clarinet. That's the method he started the instrument with. Since I began to learn, I've been using it as well. It's a great book to learn the instrument and to get a good technique. It's also a great book to learn how to read music. It's a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn the clarinet.
