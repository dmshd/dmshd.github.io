Introduction
------------

As you're learning to play the clarinet, you are looking for fun little pieces to play. Easy studies from Jacques Lancelot are perfect for a beginner and will help you to improve your technique while having fun playing something that sounds good.

This is the second study from the book Etudes faciles for clarinette by Jacques Lancelot.

On this second lesson, there is now tied notes, crescendos and decrescendos. The notes are still in the same range as the first lesson, but the rhythm is a bit more complex. There are also alterations (sharps in front of some notes).
