## Introduction

When I have to generate a favicon from a picture, I like doing it mywelf with a photoshop clone running online and which is accessible on the website called [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/). It is free and you don't need to create an account. What I like about Photopea is that it instably runs like a clockwork on my browser and I don't need to install anything on my computer. I once studied Photoshop and using Photopea reminds me of good memories on older versions of Photoshop.

## How to generate a favicon from a picture with Photopea

### Open the picture

First, you need to open the picture you want to use as favicon. You can do this by clicking on "File" and then "Open". You can also use the shortcut `Ctrl+O`.

Then, I suggest that you resize the image to a smaller size. You can do this by clicking on "Image" and then "Image Size". You can also use the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+I`. I'm using 48x48 pixels as size for a tradinational favicon.

### Save the favicon

Once you have resized the image, you can save it as a favicon. You can do this by clicking on "File" and then "Export as" > More > .ICO (I'm using .ico as format).

There are many ways to generate a favicon from a picture. I personnaly like using Photopea when all I need is a simple favicon. I hope this article will help you to generate a favicon from a picture with Photopea.
