&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beginner clarinet exercise to achieve better sounding notes by the Italian clarinetist and composer Giuseppe Magnani. This exercise is from the book &lt;em&gt;Clarinet Method&lt;/em&gt; by Giuseppe Magnani. This book is a collection of clarinet exercises and etudes by the Italian clarinetist and composer Giuseppe Magnani. The book can be easily found on Google for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The translated description of the exercise from the book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The tied notes are executed by attacking the first note with the same quick movement of the tongue touching lightly and directly on the tip of the reed without ever interrupting the emission of the breath so that the notes are tied together with a full sound.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-youtube-video-of-the-exercise"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Advices from Cally about that exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When building up new embouchure habits, take short breaks to rest muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With this exercise, you want to try to keep a consistent pure tone by blowing evenly from the beginning to the end of each phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carefully listen for tuning while doing it. Are you in tune with yourself on each of these intervals ? Don't stress about it because it will get better over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a short after playing each phrase to reset the embouchure and make sure that you're breathing with a full breath of air&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of doing this once a day every day for a week two weeks three weeks, your embouchure is going to be pretty solid and it'll be a lot easier to set up your embouchure when you're playing much more difficult music so think about this as endurance and strength training for your face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play those all very Legato as smooth as you can start to finish for for each of these phrases and think about keeping everything as consistent as possible with your mouth position your tongue position your your air flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more consistent you can be when you're playing registers going up down low up and down the more consistent you can keep everything the better your sound is going to be overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
